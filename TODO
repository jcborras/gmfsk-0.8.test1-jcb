Features that might one day be implemented in gMFSK. Actually this
is only for me to remember my own ideas and ideas suggested by
other people. Some of these will probably never fly... But if you
see something that you would _really_ like to see in gMFSK, email
me and I may bump that idea up the list. These are not in any
particular order however.

 - International character set support. (Hellschreiber already has this.)

 - A "log to file" for Feldhell. Perhaps save the bottom most papertape
   as a png every time it is filled (scrolled upwards).

 - "Start QSO" button. This would reset the start time of the QSO to
   current time.

 - Query remote log for name/qth/etc data from a possible earlier QSO
   with this callsign. Needs Xlog support.

 - NET or Lock TX checkbutton.

 - Color waterfall.

 - Adjustable (mode specific?) AFC capture/scan speed.

 - Callcheck, ie. scan received text for callsigns and grab the
   callsign to QSO data.

 - A completely separate modem engine or a TNC emulation mode.

 - AutoCQ

 - Resync button for MT63. (Hitting the Abort button is equivalent!!!)

 - simultaneous decoding of multiple signals.

 - replay received audio when clicking on a new signal.

 - Amtor/pactor (receive only?)

 - IMD display for PSK31

 - FMHELL

 - Video-ID mode

 - Configurable waterfall font (fix drawing first)

 - REV doesn't on MT63 and OLIVIA, needs to be fixed.

 - Cwdaemon support

 - Support for inputting tx-data from a UDP socket

 - CAT command macros (for changing frequency, mode, etc.)

 - Support for scripts that are automatically run when gMFSK starts/stops,
   TX/RX is switched or mode is changed. (Could be used to set/save
   mixer levels, control special hardware for eg. PTT etc...)
